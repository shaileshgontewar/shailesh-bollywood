            "description": "Referred to as the ‘king’ of asanas, headstand is an advanced yoga inversion. For beginners, it might seem that a headstand turns the world upside down. However, Anshuka Parwani, the celebrity yoga trainer, shared an Instagram post saying, “It looks intimidating, but once you build up to it, it becomes so easy. If you have never done one before, please make sure you practice with a certified teacher first. The procedure, as laid down by the yoga trainer is as follows Start with Vajrasana (diamond pose) and grab opposite elbows.Interlock your fingers and reduce the space between your elbows.Make sure your shoulders are nice and protracted and raise your knees.Activate your core, walk in and raise one knee to your chest and then the other and hold this position.Stay for a few seconds and build your strength.Extend one leg all the way to the top.When you feel more confident, extend the other leg.”"

If you are willing to take on the challenge, then you might want to learn some power moves from none other than Virat Kohli.The batsman, a fitness buff, often takes to social media to share his impressive workout routines. And recently, he dropped another video showcasing a power-packed workout. He also explained that power clean helps to increase “muscular coordination, leading to better power output, and enhancing overall athletic capacity”. “Such kinds of explosive compound movements yield great results not only in power and force output but also kinesthetic awareness, and neurological adaptations, which is required by athletes to train harder and run faster,” the expert mentioned.It is best to perform the exercise under guidance, especially for beginners. Also, if one has back, shoulders, or lower body joint niggles, avoid doing the power clean. During movement, if there is any pain or discomfort, it is best to discontinue and do basic stretches."

Hypertension is essentially high blood pressure, and those who suffer from it may not exhibit any symptoms initially as it develops over the course of many years. This lack of symptoms makes it undetectable in time to prevent it or take remedial action, experts say.“Holistic practices like yoga, meditation, and mindfulness, help handle stress in a productive and effective manner. Devote your efforts to a regular practice of yogic techniques like asanas, pranayama, and meditation practice that will guarantee your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being,” said Grand Master Akshar, a yoga master."

His fitness trainer, Pawan Jatwa, recently shared a video in which the Hero actor could be seen flexing his muscles. According to Bala Krishna Reddy Dabbedi, a fitness expert, and co-founder, director at Fittr, people usually think that they can pick up from where they left and that their original strength will be the same — “but that will not be the case”. “It’s easy to compare yourself to the times when you were training regularly. But, if there has been a gap in your gymming routine, it’s reasonable to see a decline in strength, endurance, and overall muscle,” he expressed.Assess again, test your current strength levels and train accordingly, he suggested. “There is something called muscle memory which helps one get back to their previous strength levels and muscle mass, but this takes times — from a few weeks to even some months. Just be consistent and positive till you get there. On resuming, do not start with an intense program. Keep it minimal, start slow, and you may even experience muscle soreness and pain. Eventually increase the intensity with every passing week,” she said."

            "description": "Being physically active can help reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. A recent study in Diabetes Care found that women who get more steps have a lower risk of developing diabetes, compared to women who are more sedentary.1And a study in the journal Metabolites found that men who are more active have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to men who are more sedentary.2 It seems that physical activity significantly changes the body’s metabolite profile, and many of these changes are associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, says Maria Lankinen, PhD, research scientist, Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition at the University of Eastern Finland, and one of the researchers on the study published in Metabolites. Increased physical activity also improved insulin secretion.The study published in Diabetes Care focused on 4,838 older women (median age 78.9) without diabetes, who were followed for up to 6.9 years. Their steps were monitored by accelerometers to account for the number of steps and the intensity of steps, which were labeled as light-intensity or moderate- to vigorous-intensity.For diabetes among older adults, our findings indicate that moderate- to vigorous-intensity steps were more strongly associated with a lower risk of diabetes than light-intensity steps, adds John Bellettiere, PhD, an assistant professor of family medicine and public health at UC San Diego, and a co-author on the study."

            "description": "Researchers recruited 105 men and women aged 70 to 77 and split them into three groups. The first performed supervised exercise twice a week with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) at a 90% peak heart rate. The second did moderate-intensity training at 70% peak heart rate. The third, a control group, did at least 30 minutes of daily activity, but at a low intensity and didn't have heart rate measured.There was one major aspect of improvement that wasn't related to heart rate or cortical thickness, Dr. Haberg adds—it was whether the participants felt control over their choices. For example, those who were able to choose their activity, where they exercised, and whether they exercised alone or with a training buddy tended to have more beneficial outcomes.rforming an activity chosen by the individual is key to better brain health, says Haberg. Also, diligently following physical activity guidelines provides a significant cardiorespiratory effect in healthy older adults. That type of control also can be part of maintaining a regular fitness routine, previous research suggests, because it can lead to greater enjoyment with exercise. For example, one study notes that about 50% of participants in exercise programs drop out in the first 6 months, but that those who feel positive emotions tend to have significantly higher levels of program adherence"
