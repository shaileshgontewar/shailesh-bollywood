He sat next to me and curiously asked about the laptop I was using. “It’s a Surface Laptop Studio,” I replied. “Does Microsoft make its own laptops?” He admitted he wasn’t aware of the Surface brand but told me he liked the form factor of the Surface Laptop Studio. “It’s different from my MacBook Pro,” said the man who introduced himself as the owner of an architectural firm. This conversation just reinforced my belief that there will be takers for Microsoft’s experimental Surface Laptop Studio, which blends certain elements of the desktop Surface Studio and the premium 2-in-1 Surface Book. It’s a mobile workstation that’s also a sketching slate and a portable home theater. I have been using the Surface Laptop Studio for a few days, and I am in love with this device even though it is not perfect. Here is my review."

Sometimes, it is an eclipse, sometimes it is a meteor shower. But no matter what event, it is an occasion that you should not miss. Here, we have put together a list of celestial events that we can look forward to seeing in 2022.After the partial eclipse visible in certain parts of South America on April 30 this year, there is only one more solar eclipse left for us to witness: a partial one that will happen on October 25 and will be visible in Europe, Northeast Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia, including India. The greatest part of the eclipse will be visible to viewers in India so save the date on your calendar.The total lunar eclipse that occurred on May 16 this year will not be the only one this year: another total lunar eclipse is predicted to happen once again on November 8 this year. However, just like the previous full lunar eclipse, it is unlikely that this one would be visible from India. But just like the one in May, the lunar eclipse in November will also presumably be live-streamed by multiple sources, allowing you to catch a glimpse."

            "description": "Indian electric two-wheeler manufacturer Ather Energy has given an official statement about the fire that happened in one of its showrooms in Chennai on May 27. Shortly after the incident was reported, Ather’s official Twitter handle confirmed the fire while saying that no employee was harmed during the incident.According to a statement issued by the company later, the incident happened due to a vehicle that was brought into the showroom for servicing after it had an accident. Since there was a lot of dust and mud on the vehicle, the staff at the service centre reportedly used a high-pressure water wash to clean the vehicle before inspecting it.Ather says that the service team discovered some cracks in the top casing of the battery pack. But by then, water had entered the battery casing due to the high-pressure wash. The company says that letting in water into the battery is an “impossible to solve scenario,” and that the scooter was “moved to a safer area,” as soon as this was observed."

Starting at Rs 23,999, the phone comes with a Snapdragon 778G  processor, 66W fast charging, and other features, which are geared towards gaming. Now I have used a number of phones running this same processor already, and all of them seem to target a particular use case. The Xiaomi 11 Lite NE 5G for instance, is a compact phone, while the Realme 9 5G SE is a gaming phone on a budget.The iQOO Z6 Pro doesn’t seem to hit a particular string, and neither is it the most affordable phone with the chip. So should you care about this phone at all? Let’s find out.iQOO Z6 Pro specs: 6.44-inch AMOLED 90Hz screen | Snapdragon 778G chip | 64MP + 8MP + 2MP camera, 16MP front camera | 4700mAh battery with 66W fast charging One of the first things noticeable about the iQOO Z6 Pro is a unique looking rear-design, complete with two large circles holding in the three camera sensors. The phone has a plastic body but the build quality is really nice and everything feels solid to the touch when using this."

            "description": "The UK’s antitrust watchdog started a new investigation of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, over suspicions it may have abused its dominant position across its ad tech that goes to the heart of the tech giant’s business model.The move by the Competition and Markets Authority opens a fresh front in its regulatory tussle with Google. The CMA said it was concerned Google sought to illegally favor its own ad exchange services, while taking steps to exclude the services offered by rivals.“Weakening competition in this area could reduce the ad revenues of publishers, who may be forced to compromise the quality of their content to cut costs or put their content behind pay walls,” said Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s Chief Executive Officer.Watchdogs around the world have started to home in on the huge power that firms such as Google and Meta’s Facebook wield over ad markets — striking at the heart of the tech giants’ money making machines. Google faces a separate probe by the CMA into possible collusion over the way it operates online display advertising services.The CMA has been examining the way Google buys and sells advertising since at least 2020, saying that its advertising stack is a potential conflict of interest. It’s called for powers that would even allow for a structural changes."
